1. Data Profiling Query:
Use SQL queries to profile the raw data and understand its characteristics, such as data types, null values, unique values, and distributions.
Example:-
SELECT column_name, 
       data_type, 
       COUNT(*) AS total_records,
       COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) AS unique_values,
       SUM(CASE WHEN column_name IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_values
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name, data_type;

Data Cleaning Query:
Write SQL queries to clean the data by addressing missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates.
Example:
Replace NULL values with a default value
UPDATE table_name SET column_name = 'default_value' WHERE column_name IS NULL;

-- Standardize date format
UPDATE table_name SET date_column = DATE_FORMAT(date_column, 'YYYY-MM-DD');

-- Remove duplicates
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (SELECT column_name FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);

Data Model Design:
Based on the insights from data profiling, design an initial data model capturing entities, attributes, and relationships.
Example:
CREATE TABLE Entity (
    entity_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    attribute1 VARCHAR(50),
    attribute2 INT,
    ...
);

CREATE TABLE RelatedEntity (
    related_entity_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_id INT,
    attribute3 DATE,
    ...
    FOREIGN KEY (entity_id) REFERENCES Entity(entity_id)
);

Data Quality Monitoring Query:
Develop SQL queries to monitor data quality by checking for anomalies, outliers, and adherence to validation rules.
Example:
Check for outliers in numerical data
SELECT column_name, AVG(numeric_column), STDDEV(numeric_column)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING ABS(numeric_column - AVG(numeric_column)) > 3 * STDDEV(numeric_column);

Feedback and Documentation:
Establish feedback mechanisms to capture data quality issues and improve processes iteratively.
Document data models, cleaning procedures, and quality checks for future reference and collaboration.
By employing these queries and design considerations, you can effectively infer data models and improve data quality in your raw data.
